              <h5>Short Answer</h5>
              
              <!-- Question 1. -->
              <ol type="1">
                <li><b>Explain the risk-reduction concept of separating multiple risks and give up an example of its successful use.</b> When separating, timeing is more important. For example, approaching a narrow bridge with another vehicle coming towards you.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 2. -->
                <li><b>Explain the risk-reduction concept of compromising among risks and give an example of its successful use.</b> Sometimes two or more objects threaten you path of travel at the same time. Sometimes you need to slow down and approach one hazard at a time. For example, when there are pedestrians to the right and a vehicle approaching to the left. You as the driver needs to slow down and wait for the car to pass (since it’s a greater risk) in order to safely avoid the pedestrians to your right.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 3. -->
                <li><b>Define “reasonable and prudent speed."</b> Reasonable and prudent speed provides a driver with a safe path to travel.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 4. -->
                <li><b>Identify five common traffic-conflict situations.</b> Five types of common traffic-conflict situations are oncoming vehicles, merging and existing vehicles, cars ahead of you, vehicles behind your, and intersecting vehicles and pedestrians.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 5. -->
                <li><b>Explain the steps involved in putting 3-4 second following distance rule into practice.</b> Identify a stationary checkpoint ahead, for example a road sign, light post, or other things. As soon as the rear of the vehicle ahead of you passes the checkpoint count for three to four seconds. When the front of your vehcile reaches the checkpoint, stop counting.</li>
