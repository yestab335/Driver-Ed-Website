              <br>
              <h5>Short Answer</h5>
              
              <!-- Question 1. -->
              <ol type="1">
                <li><b>Define "Graduated Driver Licensing" and explain each of the three stages of licensure.</b> GDL programs are aimed to assist new drivers by encouraging the development of basic knowledge and abilities. The three stages of licensure are a learner's permit, an intermediate (or provisional) license, and an unrestricted or full license.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 2. -->
                <li><b>List and explain the three characteristics of risk.</b> The three characteristics of risk are injury, damage, and loss that is associated within a driving situation. Every minute you are on the road as a rookie driver, you are putting yourself in danger. There's always the chance that something may go wrong, and crashes can happen on any sort of road. New drivers have a tendency to underestimate the risks of driving on any road, believing that the likelihood of being involved in a collision is smaller than it actually is. But risk can be reduced when taking necessary actions by conducting visual searches and gathering information from those searches.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 3. -->
                <li><b>Explain how to perform a systematic visual search.</b> In a systematic approach, look for clues in and around your chosen line of travel, then repeat the practice as you progress. Use only quick glances instead of staring.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 4. -->
                <li><b>Explain the benefits of conducting supervised driving sessions.</b> Supervised driving sessionsÂ can assist young drivers get the experience they need to be a safe driver during their first few years on the road.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 5. -->
                <li><b>Describe the Perceive --> Decide --> Act sequence and how it applies to reduced risk driving.</b> To perceive means to identify potential hazards within the driving scene. To decide means to figure out a way out of the hazard without harming yourself or others around you in the driving scene. And to act means to execute your decided plan. This applies to reduced risk driving because PDA (Perceive, Decide, Act) trains new drivers to identify potential hazards within a given driving scene and to execute a plan that will most likely not harm the driver themself or the others drivers/passengers around them.</li>
