# About Me
Hello! My name is Yasser Tabora but, people call me Ryan (or Rayan). The purpose of this website is to submit my Driver's Education homework. There will be two ways to access my homework responses.

Your first option as the user is to navigation to the top of the page into the navigation bar. Under the dropdown menu titled "Homework," select the chapter you'd like to view.

Your second option as the user is to scroll down to the bottom of the page and look for a section titled latest homework. There will be a link that will always direct you to the most recent homework questions assigned.
