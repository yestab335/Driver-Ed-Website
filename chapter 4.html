              <h5>Short Answer</h5>
              
              <!-- Question 1. -->
              <ol type="1">
                <li><b>List five good habits you should develop when starting a vehicle engine.</b> Five good habits your should develop when starting a vehicle engine is to check to encure the parking brake is set, check to ensure the gear selector lever is in park, turn the key clockwise to start the engine or use the push to start button, release the key as soon as the engine starts, and let the engin idle of 15 to 20 seconds before you start driving.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 2. -->
                <li><b>Explain how to perform the hand-to-hand, hand-over-hand, and steering while backing techniques.</b> Hand-to-hand steering happens when you are turning a slight or small curve in the road. Both hands grip the wheel using little to no hand/finger movements. One hand pushes up, while the opposite hand slides up and pulls down alon g the wheel to provide additional steering input of stabilized steering. Hand-over-hand steering is when the driver reaches across the steering wheel to grasp the opposite side and pulls the wheel over the top, reapeathing the process as many times as needed. For steering while backing, the driver should only use one hand, place the car in reverse, and back up in a straight line at a slow speed until their car is able to maneuver without hitting anything else around it.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 3. -->
                <li><b>List and explain the four levels of acceleration.</b> The first level of acceleration is called <i>idle acceleration</i>. It works by releasing pressure from the brake pedal which results in slow forward movement. The second level of acceleration is called <i>light acceleration</i>. It works to maintain slow forward motion or allow speed to increase gradually with minimum weight shift. The third level of acceleration is called <i>progressive acceleration</i>. It works by applying firm pressure on the accelerator to increase speed. The fourth level of acceleration is called <i>thrust acceleration</i>. It works by a firm push or thrust of accelerator for increased acceleration. This generally shifts more weight to the rear wheels.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 4. -->
                <li><b>List and explain the four levels of deceleration.</b> The first level of deceleration is called <i>idle deceleration</i>. It works by releasing the accelerator and stops the vehicles forward propulsion. The vehicle will continue to move forward but it will be coasting forward rather than being propelled by an engine. The second level of deceleration is called <i>controlled or squeeze braking</i>. It's done with sufficient pressure to slow the vehicle while avoiding abrupt weight transfer. The third level of deceleration is called <i>threshold braking</i>. It's the application of brake pressure to a point just short of locking up the brakes. The fourth level of breaking is called <i>trail braking</i>. It's used to smoothly and gradually reduce brake pedal pressure at the end of a braking maneuver.</li>
                
                <!-- Question 5. -->
                <li><b>Describe how you might communicate to drivers behind you when you plan to slow or stop your vehicle.</b> One way of communicating to drivers behind me when I plan to slow or stop my vehicle is by waving or using the dedicated hand signals (Left, right, and stop). Another way is by stepping on the brake six times before applying the desired amount of brakes to give the drivers behind me a quick warning/heads up.</li>
